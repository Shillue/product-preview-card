## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexible box
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

With this project you can recap the semantic markup of HTML and CSS. Additionally, we can review how to place a different image on different screen sizes, in the same project.

### Continuous development

I will continue to focus on Flexbox to improve and improve it more and more.

### Useful resources

- [Sample Resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_text_letter-spacing.php) - This helped me understand how to put space between elements and turn lowercase letters into larger ones.
